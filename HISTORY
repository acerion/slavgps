Since today every source code file in src/ directory (with exception
of files in src/libjpeg and src/misc) has extension .cpp (or .h, of
course) and is compiled with C++ compiler. The compilation of whole
application is successful, and resulting executable doesn't crash too
often. I can even open a gpx file and do few other operations.
This small milestone has been achieved with commit b07dc5bb6e958739c9fd28d247002b2d64895b27

I'm starting to convert files to cpp. For now it's just change of file
name extension + changes necessary to compile a file with g++.
Object-oriented changes and other higher-level changes will come
later. First file renamed to cpp in 8db4ddd3e960ce80d25a172b41a5103690e8c1d2
