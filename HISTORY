With today's commit almost all c++ files (with the exception of most problematic ones) are a part of QT application and are compiled into final binary.
There are still large sections of code that are disabled with preprocessor directives: gtk code, code relying on some other disabled code, code that wouldn't compile for one reason or another. But at least that one step - having (almost) all files included in compilation process - is behind me now.

With today's commits I can display selected SRTM files in viewport.
Still lots of work is needed, but it's a big step in good direction.

This commit that I've made today:
09c0a5334196e5737d9f94b12ca3a3d3228fa826
breaks GTK application. From now on, the GTK application will be broken.
There will be less and less gtk code in code base, and more of QT code.

Committed first files with QT5 UI. These files implement just a toy
application, without any signal or methods or variables, but we have
to start somewhere...

Committed first switch from glib container to C++ container (unordered map).

Committed first non-trivial rewrite of GObject class hierarchy into C++ class hierarchy (VikMapSource and related classes into MapSource and related classes).

Since today every source code file in src/ directory (with exception
of files in src/libjpeg and src/misc) has extension .cpp (or .h, of
course) and is compiled with C++ compiler. The compilation of whole
application is successful, and resulting executable doesn't crash too
often. I can even open a gpx file and do few other operations.
This small milestone has been achieved with commit b07dc5bb6e958739c9fd28d247002b2d64895b27


2016.04.05
I'm starting to convert files to cpp. For now it's just change of file
name extension + changes necessary to compile a file with g++.
Object-oriented changes and other higher-level changes will come
later. First file renamed to cpp in 8db4ddd3e960ce80d25a172b41a5103690e8c1d2
