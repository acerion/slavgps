This is a fork of viking (http://viking.sf.net/). See README.viking
for details about viking software. I am in no way affiliated with
viking project.

The plan for this project is following:
1. Convert the project from C to C++
2. Convert the project from GTK to QT
3. ???
4. Profit

I have created this project because of point 4: I hope to know C++ and
QT by the time the conversion from points 1 and 2 is completed.

Hopefully at step 4 this application will still resemble viking, it
will be just in C++/Qt.

After completing step 4, I plan to develop this project further to
meet my other goals: I want to have an application that I can use in
some other project. This may mean that from day one I will
purposefully neglect, and after step 4 maybe even remove some features
of this application that users of viking like or need.

Please notice that this is my personal project, which means that at
some point my goals and your goals will be totally different and you
will become disappointed with this application.

Don't rely on this application. It won't be doing what you want it to
do.

Don't rely on me. I won't implement features that you would like to
see in this application.

Patches are not welcome.

Small, well commented and documented patches that I can understand and
that I need are welcome.
